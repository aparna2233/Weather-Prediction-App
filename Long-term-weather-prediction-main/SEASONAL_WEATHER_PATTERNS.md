# 🌦️ Seasonal Weather Patterns Feature

## Overview
Added realistic seasonal weather patterns based on Indian climate with three distinct seasons and appropriate temperature ranges and rainfall patterns.

## Seasonal Definitions

### 🌞 Summer (March - May)
- **Months**: March, April, May (3, 4, 5)
- **Temperature Range**: 30°C - 43°C
- **Humidity**: 30% - 50% (Low)
- **Rain Probability**: Low (20% base)
- **Characteristics**: Hot and dry conditions

### 🌧️ Monsoon (June - October)
- **Months**: June, July, August, September, October (6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
- **Temperature Range**: 25°C - 30°C
- **Humidity**: 70% - 95% (High)
- **Rain Probability**: High (80% base)
- **Characteristics**: Warm and very wet conditions

### ❄️ Winter (November - February)
- **Months**: November, December, January, February (11, 12, 1, 2)
- **Temperature Range**: 18°C - 25°C
- **Humidity**: 40% - 65% (Moderate)
- **Rain Probability**: Moderate (30% base)
- **Characteristics**: Cool and pleasant conditions

## How It Works

### Backend Logic

The system automatically determines the season based on the selected date's month:

```python
if month in [3, 4, 5]:  # Summer
    base_temp = 30-43°C
    rain_factor = 0.2 (low)
    
elif month in [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]:  # Monsoon
    base_temp = 25-30°C
    rain_factor = 0.8 (high)
    
else:  # Winter (11, 12, 1, 2)
    base_temp = 18-25°C
    rain_factor = 0.3 (moderate)
```

### Latitude Adjustment

Temperature is adjusted based on latitude:
- Locations closer to the equator (latitude 0°) are warmer
- Locations farther from equator are cooler
- Adjustment formula: `(30 - abs(latitude)) / 10`

### Rain Probability

Rain probability is calculated using:
- Base ML model prediction
- Seasonal rain factor multiplier
- Monsoon season has 80% higher rain probability
- Summer has 20% lower rain probability
- Winter has 30% moderate rain probability

## Testing the Feature

### Test Summer (Hot & Dry)
1. Select any location on the map
2. Choose a date in **March, April, or May**
3. Click "Predict Weather"
4. **Expected Results**:
   - Temperature: 30-43°C
   - Season: "Summer"
   - Low rain probability
   - Low humidity (30-50%)
   - May trigger "Very Hot" warning

### Test Monsoon (Rainy)
1. Select any location on the map
2. Choose a date in **June, July, August, September, or October**
3. Click "Predict Weather"
4. **Expected Results**:
   - Temperature: 25-30°C
   - Season: "Monsoon"
   - High rain probability (60-90%)
   - High humidity (70-95%)
   - May trigger "Very Wet" warning

### Test Winter (Cool)
1. Select any location on the map
2. Choose a date in **November, December, January, or February**
3. Click "Predict Weather"
4. **Expected Results**:
   - Temperature: 18-25°C
   - Season: "Winter"
   - Moderate rain probability
   - Moderate humidity (40-65%)
   - Pleasant conditions

## UI Display

The season is now displayed in the prediction results:

```
📅 Date: 2025-07-15
🌤️ Season: Monsoon
📍 Location: 28.61°, 77.21°
```

## Example Predictions

### Summer Example (April 15)
```json
{
  "temperature": 38.5,
  "temperature_max": 41.2,
  "temperature_min": 35.8,
  "rain_probability": 15.3,
  "humidity": 42.1,
  "season": "Summer"
}
```
**Weather Comment**: 🔥 Very Hot - Max temperature 41.2°C exceeds 32°C threshold

### Monsoon Example (August 20)
```json
{
  "temperature": 27.8,
  "temperature_max": 29.5,
  "temperature_min": 26.1,
  "rain_probability": 78.4,
  "humidity": 85.3,
  "season": "Monsoon"
}
```
**Weather Comment**: 💧 Very Wet - High humidity at 85.3% (threshold: 70%)

### Winter Example (January 10)
```json
{
  "temperature": 21.3,
  "temperature_max": 23.8,
  "temperature_min": 18.9,
  "rain_probability": 25.7,
  "humidity": 52.4,
  "season": "Winter"
}
```
**Weather Comment**: ✅ Pleasant Conditions - All parameters within comfortable ranges

## Benefits

1. **Realistic Predictions**: Weather now follows actual seasonal patterns
2. **Regional Accuracy**: Reflects Indian climate patterns
3. **Better Planning**: Users can see expected conditions for each season
4. **Educational**: Helps users understand seasonal variations
5. **Threshold Alerts**: Seasonal extremes trigger appropriate warnings

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`backend/app.py`**:
   - Added seasonal logic based on month
   - Temperature ranges for each season
   - Seasonal rain factors
   - Season name in response
   - Changed port to 5001

2. **`frontend/src/App.js`**:
   - Updated API endpoint to port 5001
   - Added season display in results
   - Season shown with emoji 🌤️

## Configuration

### Customizing Seasons

To modify seasonal patterns, edit `backend/app.py`:

```python
# Change temperature ranges
if month in [3, 4, 5]:  # Summer
    base_temp = np.random.uniform(30, 43)  # Adjust these values
    
# Change rain probability
rain_factor = 0.8  # 0.0 (no rain) to 1.0 (high rain)

# Change humidity ranges
humidity = np.random.uniform(70, 95)  # Adjust these values
```

## API Response Format

```json
{
  "rain_probability": 78.4,
  "temperature": 27.8,
  "temperature_max": 29.5,
  "temperature_min": 26.1,
  "humidity": 85.3,
  "wind_speed": 12.5,
  "heat_index": 28.9,
  "wind_chill": 27.8,
  "aqi": 95,
  "aqi_category": "Moderate",
  "season": "Monsoon",
  "location": {
    "latitude": 28.61,
    "longitude": 77.21
  },
